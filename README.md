# MikuPiano
Using C++ to build a virtual piano program.
This program is build with SFML 2.5.1 engine and C++14. 
The resources files contains 36 piano keys and 1 arial.ttf font file.
When I design this program, I found that, 26 letters + 10 digits is 36, just fit for our need with keyboard. So I chose C3 -> G5 for this.
Just enjoy it!
